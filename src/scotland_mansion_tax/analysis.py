Core analysis module for Scottish Mansion Tax calculations.

Revenue Calculation:
    Revenue = Stock × Average Rate
            = 11,481 × £1,607
            = £18.5m

    Where:
    - Stock (11,481): Total £1m+ properties in Scotland (Savills, 2022)
    - Average Rate (£1,607): (89% × £1,500) + (11% × £2,500)
    - Band split from Savills 2024: 416 sales £1m-£2m, 50 sales £2m+

    Sales data (391 from RoS) is only used for GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION,
    not for calculating total revenue.
