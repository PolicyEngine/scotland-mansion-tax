# UK High Value Council Tax Surcharge Analysis

Analysis of the high value council tax surcharge announced in the November 2025 UK Budget, estimating revenue allocation by Westminster constituency.

## Policy Summary

From the [OBR Economic and Fiscal Outlook (November 2025)](https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-november-2025/):

- **Effective date**: April 2028
- **Threshold**: Properties valued over £2 million (in 2026 prices)
- **Surcharge bands**:
  - £2m-£2.5m: £2,500/year
  - £2.5m-£3m: £3,500/year
  - £3m-£5m: £5,000/year
  - £5m+: £7,500/year
- **Revenue estimate**: £0.4 billion in 2029-30 (post-behavioural)
- Revenue flows to central government (not local authorities)

## Methodology

1. **Property data**: 2024 Land Registry Price Paid data (881,757 transactions)
2. **Price uprating**: Uprate 2024 sale prices to 2029-30 using OBR house price growth forecasts (~13.4% cumulative)
3. **Surcharge calculation**: Apply band structure to each property above £2m threshold
4. **Allocation**: Calculate each constituency's share of total implied surcharge from sales data, then allocate OBR's £400m estimate proportionally

### Key Limitation

This analysis uses **sales data**, not housing stock. Property sales represent ~5-10% of stock annually. The OBR's £400m estimate is based on the full housing stock (via Valuation Office data). Our analysis found:

- Implied surcharge from 2024 sales: £44.3m
- OBR estimate (housing stock): £400m
- Ratio: ~9x (consistent with stock/sales relationship)

We allocate the OBR total proportionally by constituency based on sales patterns.
