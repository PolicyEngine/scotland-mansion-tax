"""
Scottish Mansion Tax Analysis by Scottish Parliament Constituency

Distributes council-level mansion tax estimates to the 73 Scottish Parliament
constituencies using population-based weights from NRS data.

Based on Scottish Budget 2026-27 council tax reform for £1m+ properties.

Data sources:
- Council estimates: Registers of Scotland (391 £1m+ sales in 2024-25)
- Population data: NRS Scottish Parliamentary Constituency Estimates (mid-2021)
- Surcharge rates: UK Autumn Budget 2025 rates used as benchmark (OBR-confirmed)

Methodology:
1. Within each council, sales are distributed to constituencies proportionally
   by population (transparent, reproducible approach using official data)
2. Revenue calculated using UK rates as benchmark since Scotland hasn't announced rates
